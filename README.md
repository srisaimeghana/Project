Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our smart cradle utilizes a microphone to detect your baby's cries, triggering a response from a servo motor to gently soothe them back to sleep with a gentle rocking motion.
But that's just the beginning. Our system goes beyond just sound detection. It also monitors the temperature and humidity levels around your baby. When conditions become unfavorable, an alert notification is promptly sent to your mobile application, allowing you to take immediate action to ensure your baby's comfort and well-being.With the touch of a button on your mobile app, you have control over the built-in fan. Need to cool things down a bit? Simply press 'ON' to activate the fan, providing a gentle breeze to keep your baby comfortable. And when it's time to rest, just press 'OFF' to halt the fan's rotation.
Safety is paramount, which is why our smart cradle includes a moisture sensor. If any wetness is detected around your baby, an alert notification is immediately sent to your mobile application. Additionally, a bulb automatically illuminates to ensure visibility and quick action to address the situation.
Our IoT-based smart cradle redefines the concept of baby care, offering convenience, safety, and peace of mind for modern parents.
